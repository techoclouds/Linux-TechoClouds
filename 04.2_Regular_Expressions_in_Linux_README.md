# Demystifying Regular Expressions

## Introduction to Regular Expressions
Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They are incredibly powerful for searching and manipulating text.

## Basic Regex Patterns
- **Literals**: Direct matches of characters or words.
- **Metacharacters**: Special characters that alter the meaning of regex (e.g., `.` matches any single character).

## Using Regex in Linux Commands
### Grep with Regex
- Example: Use `grep` to find lines that start with "TechoClouds".
  ```bash
  grep '^TechoClouds' example.txt
  ```

### Sed Substitutions
- Example: Replace any number with "N" in a document.
  ```bash
  sed 's/[0-9]/N/g' document.txt
  ```

## Advanced Regex Concepts
- **Quantifiers**: `*`, `+`, and `?` control how many times a pattern should match.
- **Character Classes**: `[abc]` matches any single character within the brackets.
- **Grouping and Alternation**: Parentheses group patterns, and `|` alternates between them.

## Practical Applications and Exercises
1. Create a regex to match email addresses and use it with `grep` to extract emails from a text file.
2. Write a regex that matches dates in "YYYY-MM-DD" format and use `sed` to replace them with "DD-MM-YYYY".
