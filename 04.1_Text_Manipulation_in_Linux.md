## Introduction
The ability to manipulate data directly from the Linux command line is an invaluable skill for any technology enthusiast. This sub-chapter introduces you to the fundamental commands for text processing in Linux, focusing on practical applications and examples that align with TechoClouds' dedication to hands-on learning.

## Grep: Searching for Patterns
`grep` is a powerful command used to search text for patterns defined by a regular expression. It's the go-to tool for filtering and extracting information from files or command output.

### Basic Search
- Command: `grep 'pattern' filename`
- Example: Find the word "TechoClouds" in a file.
  ```bash
  grep 'TechoClouds' example.txt
  ```

### Case Insensitive Search
- Option: `-i`
- Example: Search for "techoClouds" regardless of case.
  ```bash
  grep -i 'techoClouds' example.txt
  ```

## Sed: Stream Editing
`sed` is a stream editor for transforming text on a line-by-line basis. With `sed`, you can easily perform text substitutions, deletions, and more.

### Substituting Text
- Command: `sed 's/old/new/g' filename`
- Example: Replace "Linux" with "TechoClouds Linux".
  ```bash
  sed 's/Linux/TechoClouds Linux/g' config.txt
  ```

## Awk: Pattern Scanning and Processing
`awk` is a versatile programming language designed for text processing. It excels at extracting data, text formatting, and producing reports.

### Printing Specific Fields
- Command: `awk '{print $1, $3}' filename`
- Example: Print the first and third columns of a CSV file.
  ```bash
  awk -F, '{print $1, $3}' records.csv
  ```

## Combining Tools for Complex Tasks
Leveraging the power of `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` in combination can solve complex text processing tasks efficiently.

### Example
Extract lines containing "TechoClouds", replace "server" with "cloud server", and print the first two words.
  ```bash
  grep 'TechoClouds' log.txt | sed 's/server/cloud server/g' | awk '{print $1, $2}'
  ```

## Exercises
1. Use `grep` to find all instances of "http" or "https" in a web server log file.
2. Write a `sed` command to anonymize email addresses in a text file.
3. Use `awk` to sum the disk space used by files listed in an `ls -l` output.
