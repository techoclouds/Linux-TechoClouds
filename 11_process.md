### Content

#### 1. Understanding Programs, Processes, and Threads

- **Program:**
  - A set of instructions written in a programming language to perform a specific task.
  - Stored as executable files on the system.

- **Process:**
  - An instance of a program in execution.
  - Each process has a unique Process ID (PID).
  - Processes have their own memory space and system resources.

- **Thread:**
  - The smallest unit of processing within a process.
  - Threads within the same process share resources like memory.
  - Multithreading allows parallel execution within a single process.

**Example:**
```bash
# Listing all running processes
ps -ef
```

#### 2. Viewing and Identifying Processes

- **`ps` Command:**
  - **Usage:** `ps [options]`
  - **Purpose:** Displays information about active processes.
  
  - **Common Options:**
    - `-e` or `-A`: Show all processes.
    - `-f`: Full-format listing.
    - `-u username`: Show processes for a specific user.
    - `-o format`: Specify output format.
  
  - **Example:**
    ```bash
    ps -ef
    ```

- **`pgrep` Command:**
  - **Usage:** `pgrep [options] pattern`
  - **Purpose:** Searches for processes based on name and other attributes.
  
  - **Common Options:**
    - `-u username`: Search for processes belonging to a specific user.
    - `-l`: List the process name alongside the PID.
  
  - **Example:**
    ```bash
    pgrep -u alice -l firefox
    ```

- **`pstree` Command:**
  - **Usage:** `pstree [options]`
  - **Purpose:** Displays processes in a tree-like format showing parent-child relationships.
  
  - **Example:**
    ```bash
    pstree -p
    ```

#### 3. Managing Processes with `kill`, `killall`, and `pkill`

- **`kill` Command:**
  - **Usage:** `kill [signal] PID`
  - **Purpose:** Sends a signal to a specific process to perform an action (e.g., terminate).
  
  - **Common Signals:**
    - `SIGTERM` (15): Graceful termination.
    - `SIGKILL` (9): Forceful termination.
    - `SIGHUP` (1): Hang up signal, often used to reload configurations.
  
  - **Examples:**
    ```bash
    kill -SIGTERM 1234      # Gracefully terminate process with PID 1234
    kill -9 1234            # Forcefully kill process with PID 1234
    kill -SIGHUP 1234        # Send hang-up signal to PID 1234
    ```

- **`killall` Command:**
  - **Usage:** `killall [options] process_name`
  - **Purpose:** Sends a signal to all processes with the specified name.
  
  - **Example:**
    ```bash
    killall firefox          # Gracefully terminate all Firefox processes
    killall -9 firefox       # Forcefully kill all Firefox processes
    ```

- **`pkill` Command:**
  - **Usage:** `pkill [options] pattern`
  - **Purpose:** Sends a signal to processes matching the given pattern.
  
  - **Example:**
    ```bash
    pkill -u alice firefox   # Terminate all Firefox processes owned by user 'alice'
    pkill -9 firefox         # Forcefully kill all Firefox processes
    ```

#### 4. Real-World Scenario: Identifying and Managing High CPU/Memory Processes

- **Scenario:** Your system is experiencing high CPU and memory usage. Identify and terminate the problematic processes to restore normal operation.

- **Steps:**
  1. **Use `top` or `htop` to Identify High Resource Processes:**
     ```bash
     top
     ```
     - Observe the `%CPU` and `%MEM` columns to identify resource-intensive processes.
     - Note the PID of the problematic process.

  2. **Gracefully Terminate the Process:**
     ```bash
     kill -SIGTERM 5678    # Replace 5678 with the actual PID
     ```
  
  3. **If the Process Doesn't Terminate, Forcefully Kill It:**
     ```bash
     kill -9 5678           # Replace 5678 with the actual PID
     ```
  
  4. **Verify the Process has Terminated:**
     ```bash
     ps -p 5678
     ```
     - No output indicates successful termination.

- **Example Using `pgrep` to Find High CPU Processes:**
  ```bash
  pgrep -u alice -l firefox
  ```

#### 5. Process Hierarchy: Parent and Child Processes

- **Process Tree:**
  - Processes are organized in a hierarchical tree structure.
  - Each process has a Parent Process ID (PPID).
  
- **Viewing Process Tree:**
  - **Using `pstree`:**
    ```bash
    pstree -p
    ```
    - Displays the process tree with PIDs.
  
  - **Using `ps` with Tree Format:**
    ```bash
    ps -ejH
    ```
    - Displays processes in a hierarchical format.

- **Parent vs. Child Processes:**
  - **Parent Process:** The process that spawns other processes.
  - **Child Process:** A process created by another process.

**Example:**
```bash
ps -ef | grep apache2
```
- Shows Apache processes along with their PPIDs, illustrating the parent-child relationship.

#### 6. Understanding Kill Signals

- **Common Signals:**
  - `SIGTERM` (15): Requests a graceful termination, allowing the process to clean up.
  - `SIGKILL` (9): Forces immediate termination; cannot be caught or ignored.
  - `SIGHUP` (1): Hang up signal, often used to reload configurations.
  - `SIGINT` (2): Interrupt signal from keyboard (Ctrl+C).
  - `SIGSTOP` (19): Pauses the process.
  - `SIGCONT` (18): Resumes a paused process.

- **When to Use `kill -9`:**
  - Use `SIGKILL` (`-9`) as a last resort when a process does not respond to `SIGTERM`.
  - Forcibly terminating unresponsive or malicious processes.

**Example:**
```bash
kill -9 1234    # Forcefully kill process with PID 1234
```

#### 7. Orphan and Zombie Processes

- **Orphan Process:**
  - A child process whose parent process has terminated.
  - Adopted by the `init` process (PID 1).

- **Zombie Process:**
  - A process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table.
  - Occurs when the parent process hasn't read the child's exit status.
  
- **Creating a Zombie Process:**
  1. **Start a Subshell:**
     ```bash
     bash
     ```
  
  2. **In the Subshell, Start a Background Process and Exit:**
     ```bash
     (sleep 30) &
     exit
     ```
  
  3. **Back in the Parent Shell, Check for Zombie Processes:**
     ```bash
     ps aux | grep 'Z'
     ```
     - Look for processes with a `Z` status, indicating zombies.

- **Handling Zombie Processes:**
  - **Terminate the Parent Process:**
    ```bash
    kill -HUP parent_PID
    ```
    - Prompts the parent to clean up zombie processes.
  
  - **Automatic Reaping:**
    - Modern systems handle zombies automatically through the `init` process.
  
- **Orphan Processes:**
  - Generally harmless as they are adopted by `init`.
  - Rarely require manual intervention.

**Example:**
```bash
# Check for zombie processes
ps aux | grep 'Z'
```

#### 8. Background and Foreground Processes

- **Foreground Process:**
  - Runs interactively in the terminal.
  - The terminal is blocked until the process completes.

- **Background Process:**
  - Runs independently of the terminal.
  - Allows the terminal to accept new commands while the process runs.
  
- **Managing Processes:**
  - **Starting a Process in the Background:**
    ```bash
    long_running_command &
    ```
  
  - **Listing Background Jobs:**
    ```bash
    jobs
    ```
  
  - **Bringing a Background Process to the Foreground:**
    ```bash
    fg %job_number
    ```
  
  - **Sending a Foreground Process to the Background:**
    - Press `Ctrl+Z` to pause the process.
    - Then use:
      ```bash
      bg %job_number
      ```

**Example:**
```bash
# Start a process in the background
sleep 100 &

# List background jobs
jobs

# Bring the last background job to the foreground
fg %1
```

### Examples

- **Listing All Processes with `ps`:**
  ```bash
  ps -ef
  ```

- **Killing a Process Gracefully:**
  ```bash
  kill -15 1234    # Sends SIGTERM to PID 1234
  ```

- **Forcefully Killing a Process:**
  ```bash
  kill -9 1234     # Sends SIGKILL to PID 1234
  ```

- **Using `killall` to Terminate All Instances of a Process:**
  ```bash
  killall firefox
  killall -9 firefox    # Forcefully kill all Firefox processes
  ```

- **Finding a Process with `pgrep`:**
  ```bash
  pgrep -u alice firefox
  ```

- **Displaying the Process Tree with `pstree`:**
  ```bash
  pstree -p
  ```

- **Running a Process in the Background:**
  ```bash
  long_running_command &
  ```

- **Bringing a Background Process to the Foreground:**
  ```bash
  fg %1
  ```

- **Sending a Foreground Process to the Background:**
  - Press `Ctrl+Z` to pause.
  - Then:
    ```bash
    bg %1
    ```

### Exercises

   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     sleep 100 &
     jobs
     fg %1
     Ctrl+Z
     bg %1
